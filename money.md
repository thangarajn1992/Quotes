# Money

## Did you grow up thinking money was evil?

I did.

I now know that money by itself is not good or evil.

Yet we all know many people do evil things for money. Many people are afraid that if you love the money you will turn into a selfish-greedy person, which some people do.&#x20;

Always remember that if you decide to become a rich person, you can also choose to be a good person who is rich and generous, but not foolish with money.

Money is merely a tool. In the right hands, it can do immeasurable good.

In the wrong hands, incredible evil.

That is why what’s important is the person with the money and not the money itself.

Money is not a dream. Money allows dreams to come true.
