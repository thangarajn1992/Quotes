# Parent of Average Child

Beautifully said.

Mother of an average child

Yes, you read it right. I am the mother of an average child. By average, I simply mean my child is the average learner, average in scoring marks, average in sports and in extra curricular activities. What's special about her then? NOTHING as per society and school norms.

I often get asked, .... Your daughter must be good in maths and studies in general... I simply say no, she is not. She is average. Am I ashamed to say this? No.. Should I be lying that she is the best in something which she is not, in front of others? Definitely no.

My daughter is that average child who people fail to notice either for not being at the top or being at the bottom. People fail to notice her sweet smile, funny talks, tight hugs, friendly personality, kind behavior, mild manners, helpful nature because she is JUST an average child.

The school, society celebrates children who are top scorers or good in sports and extra-curricular, which rightfully they should.

Amidst all this, my average child who is a spectator and cheers her friends with full heart goes unnoticed. Her love for sports,\(even when she knows she is not going to be selected for school team\) her love for music \(even though she knows she is not going to be selected for school choir\) never diminishes. She does all this to enjoy it rather to compete.

Am I a mother who is not strict with her for not scoring at the top. Yes, I am strict to an extent and have lost my cool many times in the past. Her words pierced through me when my 11 year old daughter asked, "dad, do you not respect me"?

How many of us thought we should respect children? We adults demand our respect each and every moment of our life. Why not a child?

Among children preparing for IIT, MBBS even at a tender age of 11 years. My average child is talking about traveling the world, meeting new people and eating different cuisines. My average child might or might not become a doctor, astronaut, scientist But she is sure to grow up to be a good person, who will spread cheer.

Last but not least: Notice the average child. All that child wants is a smile or a kind word from us adults for just being herself to give her assurance to trust the world. _ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT- A MUST READ FOR EVERY PARENT_  **Each child is different, so is each parenting Style**ðŸ˜Š
